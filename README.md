# Automatic-Email-program

This simple program uses your email client to send emails automatically. Different email clients handle these smtp requests differently. You'll need to dig around a bit to make it work your particular client. Fo instance gmail uses a 2 factor authentication and you might have to disable that to allow it to work with just your credentials.
